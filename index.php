        <h3>Career Objective</h3>
          <p class="ptext">
          I am a normal geek who has a deep interest in energy and electricity.  I am a natural at the art of diagnosing anything in my world, which has made me a great service tech.  I am a completely self taught computer programmer, creator, coder and craftsmen. Other then computers, I like music, nature, oceans and life!<br>
          My passion for developing websites, building servers, and hopefully promoting music in some way makes me a very positive happy person which brings great energy into your company.  Add to that the years of experience I have under my belt, my willingness to learn or to teach depending on what you need.  <br>
          My goal is to work for a quality web development company, preferably in the local music industry, or any web development company as a senior level PHP programmer.

        <h3>Programming Languages</h3>
        <p class="ptext">
          With PHP, I prefer to write class based module code, as I find it more reusable and cleaner.

          JavaScript I can write without a framework if it's something that a framework would be overkill on size, I also am very familiar with jQuery and MooTools, also Ender and some of the newer micro libraries.  I have released many jQuery and MooTools snippets and plugins that were released open source.

          Linux servers, I love working on servers and have built and maintained many of them for my personal use or business use.  I also love building computers and hacking hardware, I currently have 2 servers in my house just for home media centers.

          General IT support, I can install software, remove software, viruses, malware, reinstall OSes, hook up your wifi printer, build a NAS device for your home network, whatever the job requires.  I do quite a bit of free lance general IT support currently.
