				<h3>Free Lance Web Developer</h3>
				<strong>2006 - 2009</strong><br />
				<p class="ptext">
				While working as a HVAC Service tech,  I created a very large online community based on online game cheating which used a Pascal based language in a custom compiler.
				After modifying and running the forums for a few years,  and having lost total interest in the game I was developing the cheat for, I started ShawnC.org which
				was a very small web development company that I ran at night after I got off work.  It mostly worked on vBulletin systems as that is what I was building modifications and things for and releasing on vBulletin.ORG
