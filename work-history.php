					While working as a HVAC Service tech, I created a very large online community based on online game cheating which used a Pascal based language in a custom compiler. After modifying and running the forums for a few years, and having lost total interest in the game I was developing the cheat for, I started ShawnC.org which was a very small web development company that I ran at night after I got off work. It mostly worked on vBulletin systems as that is what I was building modifications and things for and releasing on vBulletin.ORG
